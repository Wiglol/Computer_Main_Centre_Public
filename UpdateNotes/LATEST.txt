Computer Main Centre - Release Notes (27/01/2026)

[ AI / File Access ]

- Removed all Observer-related code and endpoints

- AI no longer has direct filesystem/Observer access

- AI now operates only through available CMC commands and user-provided context

[ Header / Status ]

- Added active AI model display to the header/status box (example: AI: qwen2.5:7b-instruct)

[ Help / Docs ]

- Added a new Help section: AI models & commands

[ GitHub / Git Helpers ]

- Added Git “force/debug” style helpers to recover from common failures automatically

- Improved reliability for messy states (wrong branch/upstream/origin, missing main, etc.)

- Better debug output when something still fails (so you can actually diagnose it)

[ Default .gitignore ]

- Updated the default .gitignore CMC generates to be more general-purpose and safer
